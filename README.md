# Project-Growth
I'm not sure of the origin of this app.

With this app, I can specify a start date, end date, and optionally select one or more
workspaces in the subscription. If no workspace is selected, the current workspace
context from the Project Picker is used.
An area chart is created showing the number of projects in the selected workspace(s).
Data can be exported as CSV.
